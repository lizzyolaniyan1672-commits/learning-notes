# Authentication & Authorization Basics

These notes summarise my introductory understanding of authentication and authorization concepts.

## Authentication
- Verifies who a user is
- Examples: username/password, tokens, sessions

## Authorization
- Determines what a user is allowed to do
- Often implemented using roles and permissions

## Tokens
- Used to maintain stateless authentication
- Common in API-based systems

Understanding these concepts is important for building secure APIs and backend services.
