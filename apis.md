# API Basics

These notes explain my understanding of APIs and how backend systems communicate, based on university work and personal learning.

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to talk to each other. It usually works by sending requests over the internet and receiving responses.

## REST APIs
REST APIs are a common way of building APIs. They:
- Use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Do not store client information between requests (stateless)
- Usually send and receive data in JSON format

## Client–Server Model
- The client (for example, a web app) sends a request
- The server handles the logic and sends back a response

## Why APIs are important
APIs allow the frontend and backend to work separately, make systems easier to scale, and are a key part of modern cloud-based applications.
